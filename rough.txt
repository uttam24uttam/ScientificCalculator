Docker image

Think of it as a snapshot of your app.

It contains:

Your code (calculator.py)

Dependencies (requirements.txt)

Runtime/Environment (Python version, OS libraries)

It’s static — just a blueprint, not running.

Docker container

A running instance of the image.

You interact with this (like your CLI calculator).

You can start/stop/destroy containers without affecting the image.

Docker Hub

It’s like GitHub but for Docker images.

A remote repository/server where images are stored.
